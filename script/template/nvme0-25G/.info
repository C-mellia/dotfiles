Creating a copy of a prebuilt archlinux install under current directory with
25G of disk size, nvme driver configured, uefi setup, and a running script,
which use qemu to boot the system

the prebuilt system is supposed to be available under $HOME/img/uefi-25G-og/
with a link to /usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd and a copy of
/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd

so the filesystem under $HOME/img will be roughly like:

.
./OVMF_CODE.fd # a link
./OVMF_VARS.fd # a writable copy
./nvme0n1 # a hard disk image created by `qemu-img create`
