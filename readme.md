# Dotfiles

This repository contains customizations that I feel works best for me. There's
a Makefile that basically links all the files to their respective locations.
Get started by typing:

```bash
$ make link
$ make copy
```

Most of the customizations can be linked just fine, but some of them usually
needs to modified a bit to fit the needs, for example xprofiles, zshrc, and
probably wezterm (because of the fonts and stuff).
