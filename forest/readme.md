# Polybar Forest theme

A theme based on the Forest theme from the [Polybar Themes](https:
//github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes). Added a spotify module that displays the
song that is currently playing.

The spotify module uses a [python module](../python_packages/dbus_spotify) I
wrote that works in a similar way as playerctl.
