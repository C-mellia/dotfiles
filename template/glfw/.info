# glfw

depends on libarray.so and liblinalg.so, which are implementions of dynamic
array(implicitly string class) and linear algebra(vec2-4 and mat2-4)
respectively

This template also included a external library nothings/stb to handle image
file decoding. It will automatically cloned the repo into `vendor/stb` whenever
the project files are copied.

callbacks and handlers are implemented in `impl.h`, resources, e.g. meshes and
shaders are loaded in `resource.h`, and important states(timer, camera...) will
be handled in `state.h`. Other miscellaneous functionalities will be handled in
other handful headers.
